Podman Secret resource



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `name` (String) Secret name. Must be unique on the container host.
- `value` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Write-only secret contents. This does not get stored in Terraform state.
- `value_version` (Number) An imaginary version number for the write-only secret value. This number must be incremented every time the secret value is updated, since Terraform does not store the secret value in its state and therefore has no way of knowing if the secret value being supplied to this resource has changed or not.

	On imported resources this attribute is set to 1.

### Optional

- `container_host` (String) URL of the container host where this resource resides

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Secret ID assigned by the container runtime
