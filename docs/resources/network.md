# podman_network (Resource)

Podman network resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  container_host = "ssh://user@localhost/run/podman/podman.sock#pubkey=ssh-ed25519+AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEahKBGUmHUA4MZgJ3pi4vZMfgB1KXbh33WExUh688Jh"
}

# Create two Podman networks to host various containerized services. The
# network called "external" can initiate connections to the outside world, and
# the network called "internal" cannot. Note that containers can be associated
# with multiple networks. For example, you might have some backend services in
# the "internal" network, and you might also have an HTTPS proxy that needs to
# forward connections to those services (and is therefore associated with the
# "internal" network), but it also needs to periodically talk to the public
# LetsEncrypt ACME server as well in order to obtain HTTPS certificates (and
# therefore it also needs to be a member of the "external" network).

resource "podman_network" "external" {
  container_host = local.container_host
  dns_enabled    = true
  name           = "external"
}

resource "podman_network" "internal" {
  container_host = local.container_host
  dns_enabled    = true
  internal       = true
  name           = "internal"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Network name. Must be unique on the container host.

### Optional

- `container_host` (String) URL of the container host where this resource resides
- `dns_enabled` (Boolean) Whether to enable resolution of private container IPs by container name inside the network. Defaults to false.
- `internal` (Boolean) Set to true to block all outbound traffic from this network. Containers will not be able to use this network to communicate with any peers outside of this network (incoming connections on published ports are unaffected). Defaults to false

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Network ID assigned by the container runtime
